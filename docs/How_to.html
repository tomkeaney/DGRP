Great! You are using Git for version control. Tracking code development
and connecting the code version to the results is critical for
reproducibility.

The results in this page were generated with repository version
<a href="https://github.com/tomkeaney/DGRP/tree/663c268fb47011ccfc702ff6bdf456a01df0e7ed" target="_blank">663c268</a>.
See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made
to the R Markdown and HTML files.

<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for
the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results
(you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or
<code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown
file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it
depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results
were generated:

<h1>Filling in the template sheet</h1>
<p><code>line</code>: Each DGRP line has been denoted a line number.
Include a row for each line that you phenotyped in this column. Please
use DGRP line number rather than the Bloomington stock number.</p>
<p><code>Trait</code>: provide a succinct name for your trait. Separate
each word with a <code>.</code> If you measured the trait in a specific
sex, please also include <code>.f</code> or <code>.m</code> as the last
two characters of the column name. If you measured the trait across both
sexes (say if you measured something to do with larvae), then no suffix
is required. For example, if you measured lifespan in females, you might
name your trait <code>lifespan.f</code>, however if you did not
discriminate between the sexes you could name your trait
<code>lifespan</code>.</p>
<p><code>Sex</code>: which sex did you measure the trait in -
<code>Female</code>, <code>Male</code> or <code>Both</code>. Both refers
to traits that have been measured in both sexes indiscriminately, and
the mean calculated from the pooled sex data.</p>
<p><code>trait_value</code>: Fill this column with the line mean values
that correspond to the lines listed.</p>
<p><code>Trait guild</code>: from the below list, select the guild that
best represents your trait.</p>
<ul>
<li>Activity<br />
</li>
<li>Behavioural<br />
</li>
<li>CHC<br />
</li>

<li>Sensory<br />
</li>
<li>Stress response<br />
</li>
<li>Temperature related</li>
</ul>
<p><code>Reference</code>: Include the citation to the published
manuscript the data was originally presented in. Use the format: Author
(year) Journal. For example, Mackay et al (2012) Nature. If the data has
not been published simply state <em>unpublished</em>. If the data was
presented in a PhD thesis and not subsequently published then you may
list “Thesis” as the ‘journal’ e.g. Keaney (2022) Thesis.</p>
<p><code>Trait description</code>: provide a brief explanation of your
trait so that a general audience can understand what you have measured.
Include units and provide an indication of what an increase in the value
of the trait means e.g. for mortality, higher values indicate lower
survival.</p>
<p><strong>Should I also include more columns like DOI/URL or various
meta-data things?</strong></p>

Fecundity was estimated every other week of the female’s lifespan as a
2-day total of eggs laid, when living with a single standard male, at
25C. Lifetime fecundity was estimated as the sum of all egg counts
across the female’s lifespan. Higher values indicate greater fecundity.
Note that female’s were eliminated form the analysis upon death.
