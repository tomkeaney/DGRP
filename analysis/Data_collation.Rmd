## Study eligibility criteria and an overview of our search

$~$

PRIMSA guideline: Specify study characteristics (e.g., PICOS, length of follow-up) and report characteristics (e.g. years considered, language, publication status) used as criteria for eligibility, giving rationale.

1) Studies must measure some quantitative phenotype using the DGRP.

2) Studies must measure the quantitative phenotype in homozygous DGRP flies. Phenotypes measured in DGRP F1s are affected by dominance and epistatic interactions that are not present in DGRP homozygotes. This means we are unable to calculate genetic correlations between heterozygous and homozygous flies. 

3) Studies must phenotype > 20 DGRP lines (**likely to be a lot more than this**). Correlation coefficients are unreliable when there are few data points (perhaps 80+ when we do correlation analysis).

4) Studies with poor data collection protocols are removed. For example, studies that calculate line means with n = 1.

5) Studies of all publication status (preprints, theses, accepted journal articles) are considered.

6) Studies must have available data, whether this is raw or line means. Data can be sourced from the manuscript, supplementary files or tables, a data repository (e.g. dryad or github) or by correspondence with the authors.

7) Studies published at any time up to 22/7/2021 were considered (the shiny app can be continuously updated to remain current, with step by step instructions included in our manuscript on how to do this). The DGRP was formally introduced to the scientific community in 2012, so the vast majority of considered studies were published after this year. However, the DGRP was made available to some research groups before this point, so we do not impose a strict lower bound on our search year criteria. 

8) We only include studies conveyed in English. This is a convenience criterion.

## Loading the published DGRP data from Google sheets

$~$

A high percentage of the relevant literature provides the data we need in line mean form. This is the ideal format for our analysis. We worked collaboratively to conduct a non-exhaustive search of the literature for phenotypic trait measurements for DGRP lines; we collated the data in google sheets. Below we save this data as a CSV file and load it into R.

Other points to consider:

Wolbachia presence is only accounted for if the data provided is already corrected. I can correct data if needed.

```{r}

# load in phenotype data from google sheets

# This is a little shaky without an authorisation token: select NO when given Y/N option. There can be an issue with the quota resource limit of google sheets. To remedy this you can create you're own API key, so that you don't have to share quota with the rest of the world's R users for the googlesheets package. However, if the file exists, this code chunk will simply load it.

# Specify API key that you have created from the Google cloud platform

## Estimating line means from raw data

Some studies only provide the raw data they collected when measuring DGRP phenotypes. We need line mean data to calculate genetic correlations between traits. To get line means, we fit Bayesian mixed effect models and use these to estimate mean trait values for each line. Each analysis is presented in a separate tab below.

To make fitting priors easier, we standardise the data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

**The brms models won't run unless you have `stan` and `brms` installed. To install `stan` follow these [instructions](https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started). Otherwise, I've made it so you can skip to the data cleaning section and load in the csv file `"data/input/all.dgrp.phenos_combined.csv"` as a tibble/dataframe. This is the entire current dataset.**

### Dobson et al 2015

From **Supplementary Table 1**'s caption: "In the second approach (c), simpler models were fitted, in which microbiota, weight and Wolbachia status were additive, with genotype nested in experimental block as a random effect. The statistical analysis presented in Fig.1b uses these models simplified by removal of non-significant factors."

We follow this approach to best recapitulate the studies analysis, except that we allow the intercept for the random effect line to vary with microbiota treatment. This is needed in our modelling approach to estimate line specific effects of microbiota. We also include day as a blocking factor, which represents a block of data collection involving a subset of lines. This controls for micro-environmental variance between blocks of phenotyping.

### Appel et al 2016

We need to do some wrangling to fit an appropriate model for these data. The response is a learning score that is bounded between -100 to 100. It is the percentage of flies that approached a trained target compared with a control target. Negative values indicate that the flies preferred the control target; positive values indicate a preference for the trained target. This data generating process can be approximated using the beta distribution. However, we need to re-express the data so that it falls between 0 and 1. 

The authors calculate the learning score using the formula $learning.score =\frac{(Trained.odour - Control.odour)*100}{Trained.odour + control.odour}$. A value of 0 represents an even split of flies between both odours. We can convert this to the proportion scale, where this even split now = 0.5.

We can transfrom our data using the following formula:

$normalised.learning.score = \frac{learning.score - min(learning.score)}{max(learing.score) - min(learning.score)}$

### Dean et al 2018

To model copulation latency Dean _et al_ log transform the data and fit a linear model with a gaussian distribution. This model struggles to converge using `brms`, so we treat the data as time to event with right censoring for the flies that failed to mate within a 2 hour window (coded as 120 in the dataset). To model this data we fit a survival model, specifying a weibull distribution. 

To model insemination capacity Dean _et al_ specify a quasipoisson distribution family because they treat the data as underdispersed counts. There is no family like this in `brms`. However, we can treat the data as binomial, with each female treated as a YES/NO for mating success. The posterior predictive check suggests this is a good fit to the data. Our predictions are also a good match with those of Dean et al.

# Dean et al fit a quasipoisson model because they treat the data as underdispersed counts. There is no family like this in brms. However, I think we can treat the data as binomial with each female treated as a YES/NO for mating success. The posterior predictive check suggests this is a good fit to the data.

### Duneau et al 2018

We fit a slightly different parathion model to that presented in the manuscript. This is because some lines are resistant to parathion, leading to heavy sensoring. This results in two groups of lines: those that are susceptible and those that are resistant. The resistant lines have estimated mean survival times of 400+ days, which is not realistic for D. melanogaster. Therefore, I instead model resistance to parathion using a binomial response, which describes whether the line had surviving flies 48 hours after exposure to parathion.

### Zwoinska et al 2020 

The authors treat temperature as a continuous variable. But they only have measures at 3 temperatures, so we choose to consider temperature as an ordered predictor, following Solomon Kurz's [translation](https://bookdown.org/content/4857/monsters-and-mixtures.html#ordered-categorical-predictors) of McElreath (2020). This approach results in an improved model fit.

We have phenotype line means for 238 lines. As of the start of 2018, there are only 205 DGRP lines. There appear to be some lines that have been used in very few studies, suggesting they have been mistakenly labelled at some point.

After checking Bloomington (<https://bdsc.indiana.edu/Home/Search>) and flybase (<http://flybase.org/reports/FBrf0222220>) we found the following anomalies.

-   Chapman et al (2020): lines 273, 331, 501, 568, 709, 831, 846 - yet to be investigated, but these lines are not phenotyped in any other study...

-   Palmer et al (2018): line 575 - yet to be investigated

-   Magwire et al (2012): line 343 - yet to be investigated (only aberrant line from study)

-   Chowdhury et al (2019): line 471 - yet to be investigated (only aberrant line from study)

-   Houston (2019): line 285 - yet to be investigated

-   Watanabe ad Riddle (2021): line 854 - yet to be investigated

-   Battlay et al (2016): lines 226, 847 and 917 - there is no obvious reason for mysterious lines. No obvious typos and the paper states they GWA for 178 lines, which matches the number reported in File S2, which is where I sourced the data.

-   Katzenberger et al (2015): line 521 - no obvious typo (data is ordered by in increasing trait value). One-off issue.

-   Turner, Miller and Cochrane (2013): line 760 - no obvious typo. One off.

-   Montgomery et al (2014): lines 424 and 766 - Errors appear to be mislabeled lines. Table S3 includes RAL lines 424 and 766. Line 766 is out of numeric order in the Table. Most likely to actually be line 776 or 786. No way to tell.

-   He et al (2014): Bloomington stock number 28120 - Error appears to be a typo. Line 28120 is included in their raw data, but isn't listed in Table S2 which shows the lines used in the study. One-off issue.

-   Lafluente, Duneau and Beldade (2018): line 809 - Likely to be a typo or a labelling error. One-off issue.

Remove these lines from the dataset:

```{r}

# check how many traits each line has been phenotyped for

line_test <- all.dgrp.phenos_combined %>% group_by(line) %>% 
  summarise(n_traits = length(Trait)) %>% 
  arrange(n_traits)

# check specific lines

#print(all.dgrp.phenos_combined %>% 
 # filter(line == "556"), n = 31)

# remove the aberrant lines

all.dgrp.phenos_combined <-
  all.dgrp.phenos_combined %>% 
  filter(line != "226",
         line != "273",
         line != "285",
         line != "331",
         line != "343",
         line != "424",
         line != "471",
         line != "501",
         line != "521",
         line != "568",
         line != "575",
         line != "709",
         line != "760",
         line != "766",
         line != "809",
         line != "831",
         line != "846",
         line != "847",
         line != "854",
         line != "917"
  )

# all.dgrp.phenos_combined %>% distinct(line)

```

This still leaves 218 lines, which considering most studies report the DGRP to consist of 205 lines, is unexpected.

However, the DGRP record on flybase (<http://flybase.org/reports/FBlc0000504.html>) indicates that a total of 219 lines have been included in the DGRP at some point since its creation. We have phenotype measurements for 218 lines, and this can be explained by some lines being withdrawn from the Bloomington stock centre. Lines were withdrawn because they were very sick, sequence data was not available, or they were essentially duplicates (that is, they exhibit high genomic relatedness with another one of the lines) of other lines.

The lines that have been withdrawn but are included in our dataset are: 49, 325, 343, 80, 272, 378, 387, 393, 398, 476, 514, 554, 556, 591, 750 and 771. We choose **not to remove** these lines from our dataset, as many of the studies we include in our dataset make use of these lines.

$~$

### Accounting for population structure

**NOT DONE**

The lines that makeup the DGRP all originate from females collected at a farmer's market in North Carolina. D. melanogaster populations are quite viscous, so there are a few lines that are related to one another above and below the random expectation. Our analyses assume that lines are independent of one another. To account for this, we have two choices. We can do some complex modelling, or we can simply remove line 'duplicates' from the dataset.

The DGRP website provides the DGRP relatedness matrix we need to do this. A value of 0 indicates random relatedness, a negative value indicates that lines are less related than expected at random, and a positive value indicates that lines are more related than the population average.

For each pair of lines that have a relatedness coefficient < -0.2 or > 0.2 we can remove the line with the higher number ID.

```{r}
relatedness_matrix <- read_csv("data/input/relatedness_matrix.csv")

relatedness_matrix <- relatedness_matrix %>% as.matrix()

#relatedness_matrix %>% select(line_390, var) %>% filter(line_390 > 0.1)
  
```


$~$

### Removing data duplicates

$~$

Some studies report data that has been previously used, leading to perfect or near perfect correlations. 

```{r}
all.dgrp.phenos_combined_subset <-
  all.dgrp.phenos_combined %>% filter(Trait != "RCH.25C")

```


$~$

### Removing traits measured in heterozyogtes

$~$

Some traits appear to be quantitative, but in reality function as binary traits i.e. they either are resistant to a pesticide or they aren't, or they develop a mushroom body abnormality or they don't. Here we focus on quantitative traits, so we remove these binary traits from our dataset. **We probably don't need to remove these - seek advice**

Other traits have been measured in heterozygotes. A common cause for this manifests when the goal of a study is to observe whether genetic variation affects the response to a genetic disease or the expression of a transgenic construct. These studies are not ideal for our database, as the phenotypes they observe may be affected be dominance and epistatic interactions that are absent in the nearly completely homozygous DGRP lines. We remove these studies from our dataset.

```{r}

# Remove binary traits and those measured in heterozyogtes

all.dgrp.phenos_combined_subset <- all.dgrp.phenos_combined_subset %>% 
  filter(# binary traits
         #Trait != "mushroom.abnormal.alpha.m", 
         #Trait != "mushroom.abnormal.beta.m",

         #Trait != "mushroom.thin.beta.m",
         # heterozygotes
         Trait != "recombination.rate.3R.f", 
         Trait != "recombination.rate.X.f", 
         Trait != "eye.area.diabetes.susceptibility.2014a.m", 
         Trait != "eye.area.diabetes.susceptibility.2014a.f",
         Trait != "eye.area.diabetes.susceptibility.2014b.m",

         Trait != "CRISPR.mosaic.resistance.embryo.formation.f",

### Removing lines that have multiple trait values

For some traits, a small number of lines have >1 trait value. We fix the dataset up before it enters R, but document it here for transparency.

-   Unckless, Rottschaefer and Lazzaro (2015) G3, include line 287 twice in their provided data. Values are identical, so we simply remove the duplication.

-   Chow, Wolfner and Clark (2013) PNAS, include line 287 twice in their provided data (coincidence or not that it's line 287 again?). They measure two traits: a hazard ratio for tunicamycin-induced survival and a LT50 value. Line 287 has two different hazard ratios, but the same LT50 value. We therefore remove line 287 completely from the hazard ratio dataset, but only remove the duplicate in the LT50 dataset.

-   Hotson and Schneider (2015) G3, include line 712 twice in their provided data, for the trait `L.monocytogenes.load.m`. The duplicates provide different values. We are unable to tell which is the true value, so we remove line 712 from the dataset.

-   Adebambo et al (2020) Frontiers in Genetics, include the line 229 twice. Values are identical so we simply remove the duplication. It is unclear whether this is a scribing error on our side or in the provided data.

```{r}
# the code below reports lines that have > 1 measurement for any of the traits in our dataset 

(problems <- all.dgrp.phenos_combined_subset %>% 
  group_by(line, Trait) %>% 
  summarise(n = n()) %>% 
  arrange(-n) %>% 
  filter(n > 1)
)

# If there are 0 rows in the problems tibble, it means we've fixed them all

```

$~$

### Removing data poor traits

$~$

Some traits have been measured across a small number of lines. Correlation estimates are imprecise for these traits, so we have trimmed the dataset to only contain traits that have been measured in \> 20 lines (**this is probably still too few**).

```{r}

# this lists traits in ascending order by the number of lines they are measured in

trait_test <- 
  all.dgrp.phenos_combined_subset %>% group_by(Trait) %>% 
  summarise(n_lines = length(line)) %>% 
  arrange(n_lines)

# Remove traits that have been measured in < 20 lines

all.dgrp.phenos_combined_subset <- 
  all.dgrp.phenos_combined_subset %>% 
  group_by(Trait) %>% 
  filter(length(line) > 20) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  arrange(Reference)

```

$~$

### Save the cleaned dataset

```{r}
# now save our cleaned dataset

write_csv(all.dgrp.phenos_combined_subset, file = "data/derived/all.dgrp.phenos_unscaled.csv")

```


All up we have removed 48 traits, taking our total from 1231 to 1183

$~$

### Create data for our analysis

For the analysis presented in our manuscript, we remove the metabolite traits measured in Jin _et al_ (2020) and the microbiome traits measured in Everett _et al_ (2020).

```{r}
selected.dgrp.phenos_unscaled <- 
  all.dgrp.phenos_combined_subset %>% 
  filter(Reference != "Jin et al (2020) PLOS Genetics" & Reference != "Everett et al (2020) Genome Research")
```

## Standardise line means for each trait

$~$

Some of our traits have already been scaled, either when we have fit models to raw data or by the authors that have provided line means. For consistency and to aid comparison of variances between traits, we standardise them all here.

We scale line means by the standard deviation of each phenotype. The result is that the mean value for each phenotype is 0 with a standard deviation of 1.

```{r}
# We simply load the data if its already been saved. If not, we change the format of the data. Each row represents a single line, while each column represents a trait and contains the lines trait mean. We then scale the values for each trait specifically, so that trait has a mean of 0 and an SD of 1. 

if(!file.exists("data/derived/all.dgrp.phenos_scaled.csv")){
  
  all.dgrp.phenos_scaled <- 
    split(all.dgrp.phenos_combined_subset, all.dgrp.phenos_combined_subset$Trait) %>% # split divides the data into trait groups
    lapply(function(x){
      trait_name <- x$Trait[1]
      x <- x[,c(1,4)]
      names(x) <- c("line", "value")
      x <- x %>% 
        group_by(line) %>% 
        summarise(mean = mean(value))
      names(x) <- c("line", trait_name)
      x}) %>% 
    purrr::reduce(full_join, by = "line", match = "first") %>% 
    mutate_at(vars(-("line")), ~ as.numeric(scale(.x))) # this is the scaling step
  
  write_csv(all.dgrp.phenos_scaled, file = "data/derived/all.dgrp.phenos_scaled.csv")
} else all.dgrp.phenos_scaled <- read_csv("data/derived/all.dgrp.phenos_scaled.csv")

# Now the selected traits for analysis

if(!file.exists("data/derived/selected.dgrp.phenos_scaled.csv")){
  
  selected.dgrp.phenos_scaled <- 
    split(selected.dgrp.phenos_unscaled, selected.dgrp.phenos_unscaled$Trait) %>% # split divides the data into trait groups
    lapply(function(x){
      trait_name <- x$Trait[1]
      x <- x[,c(1,4)]
      names(x) <- c("line", "value")
      x <- x %>% 
        group_by(line) %>% 
        summarise(mean = mean(value))
      names(x) <- c("line", trait_name)
      x}) %>% 
    purrr::reduce(full_join, by = "line", match = "first") %>% 
    mutate_at(vars(-("line")), ~ as.numeric(scale(.x))) # this is the scaling step
  
  write_csv(selected.dgrp.phenos_scaled, file = "data/derived/selected.dgrp.phenos_scaled.csv")
} else selected.dgrp.phenos_scaled <- read_csv("data/derived/selected.dgrp.phenos_scaled.csv")
  
```

We can also subset the data by trait guild and then scale

```{r}
# now lets subset the data by guild - this function will make it easier

scaling_function <- function(data){
  split(data, data$Trait) %>% # split divides the data into trait groups
    lapply(function(x){
      trait_name <- x$Trait[1]
      x <- x[,c(1,4)]
      names(x) <- c("line", "value")
      x <- x %>% 
        group_by(line) %>% 
        summarise(mean = mean(value))
      names(x) <- c("line", trait_name)
      x}) %>% 
    purrr::reduce(full_join, by = "line", match = "first") %>% 
    mutate_at(vars(-("line")), ~ as.numeric(scale(.x))) %>% 
    select(-line) # this is the scaling step
