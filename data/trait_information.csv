The name of each CHC can be deciphered as follows: linear alkanes are referred to by the abbreviation n-Cx, where ‘‘x’’ is the total carbon number. Methyl-branched alkanes are referred to with a y-Me-Cx prefix, where ’y’ is the carbon onto which the methyl group is bound. For example, 9-Me-C23 is a 23 carbon chain with a methyl on the 9th carbon. For monoenes (z-Cx:1) and dienes (z,z-Cx:2) the number of double bonds is indicated after the colon and the double bond position/s are ’z’ or ’z,z""). For example, 7-C23:1 has one double bond between the 7th and 8th carbons. Higher peaks indicate a greater amount of the CHC.","Dembeck et al (2015) eLife"

"wolbachia.copy.number","91","Both","Pathogen response","Mean copy number of Wolbachia genomes carried by adults, relative to a standard nuclear reference genome of equal size. Measured using whole genome shotgun sequencing, which is not tissue specific. Higher values indicate more Wolbachia genomes, which the authors suggest is a proxy for Wolbachia density. Note that only lines found to harbour Wolbachia are inlcuded in this dataset.","Richardson (2012) PLOS Genetics"
