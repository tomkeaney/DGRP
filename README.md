# DGRP

Our progress can be veiwed [here](https://tomkeaney.github.io/DGRP/). Many of the data files produced in this project are too large to archive on github. However, they can all be produced with the supplied code, starting from the `Data_collation.rmd` file. Note that this will require you to run bayesian mixed effects models using the `brms` package, which requires `stan` to be installed (see instructions for installation at `https://mc-stan.org/users/interfaces/rstan.html`).

We do supply two data files: `all.dgrp.phenos_scaled.csv` and `selected.dgrp.phenos_scaled.csv`. These can be used to create the trait correlation matrixs found under the [Line quant gen](Analysis.html) tab.

A [workflowr](https://github.com/workflowr/workflowr) project.
